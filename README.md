# Rails Docker Demo

## Demo Objectives

* Demonstrate how a rails app works with Docker

## How to run the demo

The easiest way to kick this demo, is to use Docker - You'll need to have Docker and Docker Compose
installed. Having [`plis`](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/plis) installed is recommended to reduce
typing:

```
# Start the project using docker-compose:
docker-compose up web

# Alternatively, use plis:
plis start demo
```
